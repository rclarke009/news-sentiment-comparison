#do i need a different host above or is 0.0.0.0 correct?
#yes, you need a different host above.
#0.0.0.0 is the default host for all interfaces.
#so if you want to access the api from outside the local machine, you need to use a different host.
#for example, if you want to access the api from the internet, you need to use the public ip address of the machine.
#if you want to access the api from the local machine, you can use 0.0.0.0.
#if you want to access the api from the local machine, you can use 127.0.0.1.
#if you want to access the api from the local machine, you can use localhost.

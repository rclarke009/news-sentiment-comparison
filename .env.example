# NewsAPI Configuration
NEWS_API_KEY=your_key

# LLM API Configuration (use either Groq or OpenAI)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
# OR
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/news_sentiment
# For MongoDB Atlas, use:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/news_sentiment

# Application Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
COLLECTION_SCHEDULE=0 10 * * *  # Daily at 10 AM (cron format)

# Cron Job Security (for external cron services like cron-job.org)
# Generate a secure random string for this (e.g., openssl rand -hex 32)
CRON_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_random_secret_key_here  #this key comes from the cron-job.org website
#if you want to generate a secure random string, you can use the following command:
#openssl rand -hex 32
#this will generate a secure random string.
#you can use this string as the CRON_SECRET_KEY.
#you can also use this string as the CRON_SECRET_KEY in the cron-job.org website.
# NOT AN API KEY FROM cron-job.org, it is a secure random string for the cron job.
#   openssl rand -hex 32 #generate secret key for cron job.
add it to render environment variables.
#then you can use this key to authenticate the cron job.

#do i need a different host above or is 0.0.0.0 correct?
#yes, you need a different host above.
#0.0.0.0 is the default host for all interfaces.
#so if you want to access the api from outside the local machine, you need to use a different host.
#for example, if you want to access the api from the internet, you need to use the public ip address of the machine.
#if you want to access the api from the local machine, you can use 0.0.0.0.
#if you want to access the api from the local machine, you can use 127.0.0.1.
#if you want to access the api from the local machine, you can use localhost.



#how does fastapi work?
#fastapi is a web framework for building APIs.
#it is built on top of starlette, which is a web framework for building APIs.
#starlette is a web framework for building APIs.
